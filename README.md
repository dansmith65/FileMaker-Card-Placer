# Card Placer Module

Places card windows, so you don't have to.


# Status

__Pre-release__

This is still in early development stages, so anything and everything could potentially change; even breaking non-backwards compatible changes.



# Limitations

This module does not support the use of the "Show current record indicator in List View" layout option. Some cards may be placed 3pts off from their intended location when this feature is used.
